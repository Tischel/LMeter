LMeter is a Dalamud plugin for displaying your ACT combat log data. The purpose of this plugin is to provide a highly customizable dps/hps meter without having to rely on clunky web-based overlays.

## How to Install

LMeter is not available in the standard Dalamud plugin repository and must be installed from my third party repository.
